- Non-technical overview of the subject area and problem statement / opportunity you identified
	- Identify wallets and transactions to or from those wallets that were used in fraudulent transactions
	- Fraudulent transactions are classified as transactions from victims in randomsware attacks, black market place payments for illegal goods.
	- Having a model trained and actively reviewing transactions on the blockchain, this could aid law enforcement and tip them off to possible fraudulent transactions.
	- This would beneficial esspecially if the blockchain scales or technology evolves to handle more transactions. 

- Overview of your proposed vision using data science
	- Collect transaction data, known fraudulent transaction data, and daily price (close) data. 
	- Combined to one data set. 
	- Train a Logistic Regression model on the data. 
	- Test it with possible transactions

- Estimate of impact of solution. 
	- To assist law enforcement in detecting fraudulent transactions
	- Help trace bad actors to exchanges to help identify them

- Intro to dataset
	- Using transaction data, known fraud data, and coin price
	- Combine the datasets and drop unnecessary columns from them. 
	- Normalize the date format. (a column for month, day, year)

	- Transaction dataset is a lot
	- Only 93k rows for fraud dataset

- Next steps in data processing, feature engineering and baseline modeling.

Intro:
Bitcoin allows people to be anonymous people are able to trace who a certain user is based on the wallet address.

Objective: Identify transactions that were made using fraudulent wallet addresses to help identify the user
