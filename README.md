  <h1 align="center">Identifying Fraudulent Transactions on the Blockchain</h1>
<br/>

## Describe your project (big idea)
The big idea is to identify possible fraudulent transactions made on the bitcoin network. These transactions would be a result from Randsomware attacks and/or other fraudulent transactions such as known purchases on black market marketplaces. 

The idea is to create a model that monitors blockchain transaction data, block by block, and notifiy law enforcement if there are any possible transactions with known wallets that were previously used for transactions and to flag any other new addresses that associate with these wallet addresses. 

This will help break some of the anonminity associated with people who own the wallets and help law enforcement track down bad actors. 

## Describe your goal
The goal is to be able to classify transactions based on amount, and wallet addresses if it is possible that it was used for fraudulent activities. In order to do this a model would need to be built on previously recognized fraudulent data and to identify a pattern to these transactions and legitamite transaction data. 


## Describe your data
The data used is transactions history from 2016 - end of 2018. Also the fraudulent data set is the known fraudulent transactions from that time period and the price data. 

## Describe your work (models, analysis, EDA, etc.)
To be determined. 

## Describe your results
To be evaluated. 

## Party!
Yay, party !
