# Identifying fraudulent transactions on the Blockchain

### Describe your project (big idea)
The big idea is to identify possible fraudulent transactions made on the ethereum and bitcoin network. These transactions would be a result from Randsomware attacks and/or exploitation. 

These transactions would be reflective of previously fraudulent transactions with the use of wallets used in fraudulent transactions or the amount transfered and its frequency which would be indicative of a tumbler. 

(A tumbler is a set of wallets used to transfer crypto among itself to obfuscate the original source and destination and make it harder to track). 

### Describe your goal
The goal is to be able to classify transactions based on amount, and wallet addresses if it is possible that it was used for fraudulent activities. 


### Describe your data
The data used is known and total transaction history on both bitcoin and ethereum networks. 

### Describe your work (models, analysis, EDA, etc.)
To be determined. 

### Describe your results
To be evaluated.
