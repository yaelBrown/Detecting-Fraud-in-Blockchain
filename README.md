  <h1 align="center">Identifying fraudulent transactions on the Blockchain</h1>
<br/>

## Describe your project (big idea)
The big idea is to identify possible fraudulent transactions made on the ethereum and bitcoin network. These transactions would be a result from Randsomware attacks and/or exploitation. 

These transactions would be reflective of previously fraudulent transactions with the use of wallets used in fraudulent transactions or the amount transfered and its frequency which would be indicative of a tumbler. 

(A tumbler is a set of wallets used to transfer crypto among itself to obfuscate the original source and destination and make it harder to track). 

## Describe your goal
The goal is to be able to classify transactions based on amount, and wallet addresses if it is possible that it was used for fraudulent activities. 


## Describe your data
The data used is transactions history from 2016 - end of 2018. Also the fraudulent data set is the known fraudulent transactions from that time period. 

## Describe your work (models, analysis, EDA, etc.)
To be determined. 

## Describe your results
To be evaluated. 

## Party!
Yay, party !
